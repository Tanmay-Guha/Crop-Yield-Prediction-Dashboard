# 🌾 Crop Yield Prediction Dashboard

This is a smart web app that helps farmers and students **predict crop yield**, analyze **soil health**, and get **farming suggestions** using **Machine Learning** — all shown with beautiful graphs!

Built with:
- 💻 Dash (by Plotly)
- 🧠 Random Forest Regressor (ML)
- 📊 Plotly Graphs
- 🎨 Bootstrap Design

## 📦 Features

✅ Predict crop yield based on:
- Temperature
- Rainfall
- Humidity
- Soil nutrients (N, P, K)
- pH
- Organic matter
- Sunlight hours
- Crop type

✅ Give recommendations to improve yield  
✅ Soil Health Index calculation  
✅ Interactive graphs:
- Feature importance
- Correlation heatmap
- Yield distribution
- Pairplot

## 🛠️ How it Works

1. **Synthetic data** is generated to simulate crop yields  
2. A **Random Forest model** is trained in real-time  
3. Users input data via sliders and dropdowns  
4. Dashboard shows:
   - 📉 Predicted yield
   - 🌱 Soil health
   - ⚙️ Farming suggestions
   - 📊 Graphs and ML insights
